# b.Uniqu3 Picks — Free, Static Storefront

**What this is**  
A one-page storefront you can host for **free** on Netlify or GitHub Pages. It loads products from `products.json`, so you can add/remove items without touching code. Each product's **Buy** button links to your affiliate / TikTok Shop product.

**How to deploy (Netlify in 2 minutes)**
1) Create a free GitHub account (if you don't have one).  
2) Make a new repository and upload these files.  
3) Go to Netlify → Add New Site → Import from Git → pick your repo → Deploy.  
4) Done. You get a free URL like `https://yourname.netlify.app`.

**Edit products**  
Open `products.json` and change:
- `title`, `subtitle`, `price`
- `link` → paste your affiliate link or TikTok Shop product link
- `image` → any product image URL
- `commission` → optional (for your own tracking)
- `category`, `tags`, `featured`

**Cart**  
This is a "soft cart" for curation. Checkout goes to the product's link (Amazon, TikTok Shop, etc.).
